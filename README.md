# The RubyMine Server

## What is it?

Currently VERY VERY unstable.

RubyCraft is a server that aims to be on feature parity with the features of the regular minecraft server systems (Bukkit, Hmod/Canary, Sponge, etc). It tries to make it easy to run a production survival server under extreme memory constraints. The goal of the project is to create a server system to be on par with the big ones.

## Installation

### From GitHub

    $ git clone git://github.com/connor557/rubycraft

## Usage

### Start the server

    $ bin/server [-h host] [-p port]
